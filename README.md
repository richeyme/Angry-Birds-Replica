## Angry Birds Replica

This is a replica of the game Angry Birds that I am making in order to gain experience using the game engine Unity.

# So far I have achieved the following:
- Launch bird from slingshot
- Spawn in new birds after launching the last (currently up to 3 total)
- Kill pigs that are located on the structures to the right of the birds
- Particle animation initiated upon death of a pig

# What I am currently working towards making:
- A line of birds that are placed onto the slingshot after the last one is launched
- Win/Game Over screen
- Camera moving with bird across a larger level
- Different bird powers
- Better sprites
